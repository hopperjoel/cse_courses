Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
	
	Recipe Roulette

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?

	The app is designed to provide a randomized list of recipes with given
	parameters to create meal schedules

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

	How to request a REST API with input for search parameters. How to parse
	information from the API to present it in a readable format. How to create
	a basic GUI for user interface.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

	The app will require the Requests, JSON, and Tkinter modules.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

	Yes, the program will require several functions in order to operate.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?

	I will write at least a few test functions for essential functions. If time permits,
	I will write them for all of the functions in the program
