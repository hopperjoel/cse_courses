----------LESSON 11------------

Started project with a crime statistics API.
API does not currently work, as demonstrated by program and reported by discussion board

Switched program to recipe searching tool using Tasty API

API found on RapidAPI: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty/
    Spent a lot of time examining the JSON data structure to determine potential ways
    of searching and returning data

Started with website: https://www.nylas.com/blog/use-python-requests-module-rest-apis/

Read through article on requests: https://realpython.com/python-requests/

Read through article on JSON module: https://python.gotrained.com/python-json-api-tutorial/

Completed request test with error testing to determine status of connection
Completed request for recipes according to lists
Added json data manipulation variables to improve format of text data
Added multiple search url's and strings for search parameters to be used in different functions
Added input variables for user requests


----------LESSON 12 PROVE-----------

Explored the data from the API to determine accuracy of search "tags"

Created dictionary of valid and robust search tags according to categories
with value pairs of lists in order to search in a separate file to reference for randomization

Created several functions:
    retrieve_list()
    retrieve_tags()
    print_tags()
    random_tags()

Checked w3 schools for a few references on some built-in methods

No additional resources were used

Program will now create a random list of recipe tags according to user preference for several categories
or entirely at random

Program will produce x number of recipes requested by user in json object format

Program will filter and format information for user-friendly display
